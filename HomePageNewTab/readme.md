about:profile

There will be a list of profiles > click the root folder for the one that is the default.  DEFAULT PROFILE: yes

Once you open the root folder to the default profile copy the chrome folder found here into it.

Now you will be able to use the homepage | newtab I have created.

If you wish to change the search just go into about:preferences#search and choose your preferred search engine.  DuckDuckGo / Google  or Bing and others I guess.
